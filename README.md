## Hi, my name is Jhonata but you can call me Jhoow! ðŸ‘‹

I have a degree in Architecture, in college I had experiences that could contribute to the development of my creativity, develop team projects, fulfilling tasks and objectives. So I found that I feel happy and committed when I'm on a project. My course conclusion work was based on algorithmic modeling using the grasshopper tool.
I got to know programming and realized how much I liked to spend hours on the computer studying about it.
I'm currently studying Front-end development, HTML, SASS, Typescript, Javascript and React. I want to gain experience, create my portfolio and seek an opportunity in the job market.
